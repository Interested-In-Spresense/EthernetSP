== Usage
Most features are based on the original library. There are three differences from the original Ethernet library.

1:
change from
----
#include <Ethernet.h>
----
to
----
#include <EthernetSP.h>
----

2:
At the setup(), insert the following command according to the reset jumper setting:

When SJ1 is shorted at 1-2, use:
----
W5500ETH_reset(SJ1_12);
----
When SJ1 is shorted at 2-3, use:
----
W5500ETH_reset(SJ1_23);
----

3:
Insert the following command according to the SPI-SS jumper setting:

When SJ2 is shorted at 1-2, use:
----
Ethernet.init(SJ2_12);
----
When SJ2 is shorted at 2-3, use:
----
//Ethernet.init(); // Do nothing.
----

Other than that, it is the same as the original library.
